# Chat-Server-Project-CIS296
A Multi-threaded two client java chat server for Java networking and gui development course

To implement this project, we first looked at the provided examples that were uploaded to canvas to learn how to program the server and client. From those examples, we wrote code to create separate threads for each client connected to the server. Each client gets two dedicated threads, a read thread that reads messages from the client to the server, and a write thread that sends outgoing messages to the client. Each incoming message would be stored in a message record along with the client ID, and then the records would be added to an ArrayList based queue. With all these threads, we also needed to implement locks to ensure that we would not run into any cases of our message queue being empty, but still being read. The way the write threads determine which client the message goes to is through an if statement that checks if the message at the top of the queue matches its client id. If it does not match, then it sends the message to the client.
